/**
 * We intentionally do NOT include the `FormField` mixin here.
 *
 * Nova's built-in File field registers its upload payload by assigning
 * `this.field.fill = (formData) => ...` inside its mounted() — that arrow
 * function captures the selected File object from closure. The `FormField`
 * mixin's own mounted() ALSO does `this.field.fill = this.fill`, where
 * `this.fill` is the generic `formData.append(attr, String(this.value))`.
 *
 * Because parent components mount AFTER their children in Vue's lifecycle,
 * adding the `FormField` mixin to this wrapper would overwrite the child's
 * upload-aware `field.fill` with the string-only default, and the BPMN file
 * would never reach the backend.
 *
 * By skipping the mixin, the child's `field.fill` stays authoritative and
 * Nova's form submission picks up the uploaded file as expected.
